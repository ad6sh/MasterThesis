%==============================================================================

Briefly introduce research related to your thesis' topic.
Make sure to properly cite each work and that you summarize the contributions of your fellow researchers with \textbf{your own words}.
Place the citation command directly after the name of the authors, or at the end of the sentence.
Make sure the period is \textbf{after} the citation.

E.g. ``Güne\c{s} et al.~\cite{Guenes+:2008TR} present the design, architecture and implementation of the testbed developed in 2009 at the Freie Universität Berlin in their technical report.''

When describing the contribution of your fellow researchers, you usually only cite them only once; usually at the first sentence about their contribution.
However, it should be clear in the text that you are still referring to their contribution in the sentences afterwards.
\textbf{But} if you summarize strong claims, statements that present precise numbers, or other content that needs to backed up with reference, you should of course \textbf{cite them again}.
Also literal quotes always require a citation; but only use literal quotes in your thesis very rarely if at all!
